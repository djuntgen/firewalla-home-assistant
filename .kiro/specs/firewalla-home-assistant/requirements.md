# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a HACS-compatible Home Assistant custom integration for Firewalla firewall devices using the MSP API. The integration will provide comprehensive device control and monitoring capabilities through Home Assistant entities, following all HACS publication standards and Home Assistant best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MSP API Authentication and Setup

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want to easily set up my Firewalla integration through the MSP API, so that I can securely connect and manage my firewall devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the integration THEN the system SHALL provide a user-friendly configuration flow
2. WHEN I enter MSP credentials THEN the system SHALL validate authentication with clear error messages
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL discover and present available Firewalla boxes for selection
4. WHEN I select a box THEN the system SHALL establish connection and create appropriate entities
5. WHEN setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2: Device Control and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control and monitor my network devices through Home Assistant, so that I can automate firewall rules and track device status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration loads THEN the system SHALL create switch entities for device internet blocking
2. WHEN the integration loads THEN the system SHALL create switch entities for gaming device pause controls
3. WHEN the integration loads THEN the system SHALL create sensor entities for device status monitoring
4. WHEN I toggle a switch THEN the system SHALL create/modify/pause the appropriate Firewalla rule
5. WHEN device status changes THEN the system SHALL update sensor states within 30 seconds
6. WHEN rules are modified externally THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in entity states

### Requirement 3: Rule Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage Firewalla rules through Home Assistant entities, so that I can integrate firewall controls with my home automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rules exist THEN the system SHALL display active rule count through a sensor entity
2. WHEN I create rules through switches THEN the system SHALL use appropriate rule types and targets
3. WHEN I disable a switch THEN the system SHALL pause the rule (preserving it for future use)
4. WHEN rules change THEN the system SHALL update all related entity states consistently
5. WHEN rule operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain entity availability

### Requirement 4: HACS Publication Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to meet all HACS requirements, so that users can easily discover and install it through HACS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include a complete manifest.json with proper metadata
2. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include proper version information and dependencies
3. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL follow Home Assistant integration structure standards
4. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include comprehensive documentation and README
5. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include proper GitHub repository structure with releases

### Requirement 5: Reliability and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the integration to work reliably with proper error handling, so that my home automation remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle timeouts and connection errors
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens
4. WHEN entities become unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the unavailable state
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6: Home Assistant Integration Standards

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want the integration to follow platform conventions, so that it works seamlessly with my existing setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entities are created THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions and unique IDs
2. WHEN entities are created THEN the system SHALL provide proper device information and attributes
3. WHEN the integration runs THEN the system SHALL use the DataUpdateCoordinator pattern for efficient API calls
4. WHEN the integration runs THEN the system SHALL respect Home Assistant's async patterns and best practices
5. WHEN multiple Firewalla devices exist THEN the system SHALL handle them without naming conflicts

### Requirement 7: User Experience and Documentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear documentation and intuitive entity names, so that I can easily understand and use the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the integration THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
2. WHEN entities are created THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names based on device hostnames
3. WHEN I view entities THEN the system SHALL provide relevant attributes and state information
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN I need help THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation and examples

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user with multiple devices, I want the integration to perform efficiently, so that it doesn't impact my Home Assistant performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching data THEN the system SHALL use minimum 30-second update intervals to respect API limits
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching and rate limiting
3. WHEN handling multiple devices THEN the system SHALL batch API requests efficiently
4. WHEN the integration starts THEN the system SHALL initialize quickly without blocking Home Assistant
5. WHEN resources are cleaned up THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of sessions and connections
