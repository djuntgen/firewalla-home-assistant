# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a HACS-compatible Home Assistant custom integration for Firewalla firewall devices using the MSP API. The integration focuses primarily on controlling existing Firewalla rules through pause/unpause functionality, with automatic rule discovery and management. Each rule becomes a switch entity in Home Assistant, allowing users to easily enable or disable firewall rules through their home automation system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MSP API Authentication and Setup

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want to easily set up my Firewalla integration through the MSP API, so that I can securely connect and manage my firewall rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the integration THEN the system SHALL provide a user-friendly configuration flow
2. WHEN I enter MSP credentials THEN the system SHALL validate authentication with clear error messages
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL discover and present available Firewalla boxes for selection
4. WHEN I select a box THEN the system SHALL establish connection and discover existing rules
5. WHEN setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2: Automatic Rule Discovery and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the integration to automatically discover my existing Firewalla rules and create switch entities for them, so that I can control all my firewall rules from Home Assistant without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration loads THEN the system SHALL automatically discover all existing Firewalla rules
2. WHEN rules are discovered THEN the system SHALL create switch entities for each controllable rule
3. WHEN new rules are added to Firewalla THEN the system SHALL automatically create new switch entities within 30 seconds
4. WHEN rules are deleted from Firewalla THEN the system SHALL automatically remove corresponding switch entities
5. WHEN rules are modified externally THEN the system SHALL update switch entity states and attributes accordingly

### Requirement 3: Rule Control Through Switch Entities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to pause and unpause my Firewalla rules using Home Assistant switch entities, so that I can integrate firewall control into my home automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I turn ON a switch THEN the system SHALL unpause the corresponding Firewalla rule (make it active)
2. WHEN I turn OFF a switch THEN the system SHALL pause the corresponding Firewalla rule (disable temporarily)
3. WHEN a rule is paused/unpaused externally THEN the system SHALL update the switch state within 30 seconds
4. WHEN switch operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain switch availability with error indication
5. WHEN rules change state THEN the system SHALL preserve all rule configuration data and metadata

### Requirement 4: Rule Metadata and Attributes

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed information about each firewall rule in the switch entity attributes, so that I can understand what each rule controls and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switch entities are created THEN the system SHALL include rule type, target, and description as entity attributes
2. WHEN switch entities are created THEN the system SHALL include rule creation date, last modified, and rule ID as attributes
3. WHEN switch entities are created THEN the system SHALL include rule priority, action type, and schedule information as attributes
4. WHEN rule metadata changes THEN the system SHALL update entity attributes within 30 seconds
5. WHEN rules have complex configurations THEN the system SHALL present the information in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 5: Entity Naming and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want switch entities to have clear, descriptive names based on the rule information, so that I can easily identify and manage different firewall rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switch entities are created THEN the system SHALL use rule names or descriptions for entity names
2. WHEN rule names are not descriptive THEN the system SHALL use rule target and type information for naming
3. WHEN multiple rules have similar names THEN the system SHALL add disambiguating information to entity names
4. WHEN entities are created THEN the system SHALL use consistent unique ID format based on rule ID
5. WHEN entity names change THEN the system SHALL preserve entity history and configuration

### Requirement 6: HACS Publication Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to meet all HACS requirements, so that users can easily discover and install it through HACS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include a complete manifest.json with proper metadata
2. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include proper version information and dependencies
3. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL follow Home Assistant integration structure standards
4. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include comprehensive documentation and README
5. WHEN publishing to HACS THEN the integration SHALL include proper GitHub repository structure with releases

### Requirement 7: Reliability and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the integration to work reliably with proper error handling, so that my home automation remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle timeouts and connection errors
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens
4. WHEN entities become unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the unavailable state
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8: Home Assistant Integration Standards

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want the integration to follow platform conventions, so that it works seamlessly with my existing setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entities are created THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions and unique IDs
2. WHEN entities are created THEN the system SHALL provide proper device information and attributes
3. WHEN the integration runs THEN the system SHALL use the DataUpdateCoordinator pattern for efficient API calls
4. WHEN the integration runs THEN the system SHALL respect Home Assistant's async patterns and best practices
5. WHEN multiple Firewalla devices exist THEN the system SHALL handle them without naming conflicts

### Requirement 9: User Experience and Documentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear documentation and intuitive entity names, so that I can easily understand and use the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the integration THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
2. WHEN entities are created THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names based on rule information
3. WHEN I view entities THEN the system SHALL provide relevant rule attributes and state information
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN I need help THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation and examples

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user with many firewall rules, I want the integration to perform efficiently, so that it doesn't impact my Home Assistant performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching data THEN the system SHALL use minimum 30-second update intervals to respect API limits
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching and rate limiting
3. WHEN handling multiple rules THEN the system SHALL batch API requests efficiently
4. WHEN the integration starts THEN the system SHALL initialize quickly without blocking Home Assistant
5. WHEN resources are cleaned up THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of sessions and connections
