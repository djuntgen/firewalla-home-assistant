# Home Assistant Entities Created by Firewalla Integration

Based on the real API test with 83 rules, here are examples of the entities that will be created:

## Switch Entities (Rule Controls)

Each Firewalla rule becomes a switch entity that can be toggled to pause/unpause the rule.

## Sensor Entity (Rules Summary)

One sensor entity provides overall statistics:

```yaml
Entity ID: sensor.firewalla_rules_summary
Name: "Firewalla Rules Summary"
State: 83 (total number of rules)
Device: Firewalla Box 2cd09491

Attributes:
  total_rules: 83
  active_rules: 72
  paused_rules: 11
  rules_by_type:
    internet: 6
    app: 13
    category: 34
    intranet: 18
    ip: 8
    domain: 4
  last_updated: "2025-01-10T19:15:00.000000"
  api_status: "connected"
```

## Device Information

All entities are grouped under a single Firewalla device:

```yaml
Device:
  Name: "Firewalla Box 2cd09491"
  Manufacturer: "Firewalla"
  Model: "Firewalla Unknown"
  Identifiers: ["firewalla", "2cd09491-7385-479b-899e-51dd5c731b10"]
  Entities: 84 (83 switches + 1 sensor)
```

## Entity Behavior

### Switch States:
- **ON**: Rule is active (not paused) - blocking/allowing traffic as configured
- **OFF**: Rule is paused - temporarily disabled but configuration preserved

### Actions:
- **Turn ON**: Unpause the rule (activate it)
- **Turn OFF**: Pause the rule (temporarily disable it)

### Attributes Include:
- Rule metadata (type, target, action, priority)
- Timestamps (created, modified, last hit)
- Hit statistics (how many times rule was triggered)
- Scope information (which devices/groups the rule applies to)
- Schedule information (for time-based rules)
- Custom descriptions/notes

## ðŸ”§ **Rule Filtering (New Feature!)**

You can now configure which rules appear in Home Assistant using Firewalla's query syntax:

### **Configuration Options:**
- **Include Filters**: Only show rules matching these criteria
- **Exclude Filters**: Hide rules matching these criteria  

### **Example Filter Configurations:**

**Show only active app blocking rules:**
```
Include Filters:
status:active
action:block
target.type:app
```
*Result: 13 app rules â†’ 8 active blocking app rules*

**Hide paused and allow rules:**
```
Exclude Filters:
-status:paused
-action:allow
```
*Result: 83 rules â†’ 60 rules (only active block rules)*

**Show only rules for specific device:**
```
Include Filters:
device.id:"FC:34:97:A5:9F:91"
```

### **Available Filter Types:**
- **Status**: `status:active`, `status:paused`
- **Action**: `action:block`, `action:allow`
- **Type**: `target.type:app`, `target.type:category`, `target.type:internet`
- **Device**: `device.id:"MAC:ADDRESS"`, `device.name:*iphone*`

### **Filter Results from Your 83 Rules:**
- All Rules: 83
- Active Only: 71 rules
- Block Only: 60 rules  
- App Rules: 13 rules
- Category Rules: 34 rules
- Internet Rules: 6 rules

## Total Entities Created:
- **Variable entities** (depends on filters, up to 84 total)
- **83 rule switches + 1 summary sensor** (without filters)
- All grouped under **1 Firewalla device**
- Real-time status updates every 30+ seconds
- Full pause/unpause control through Home Assistant UI
- **Configurable rule filtering** to show only what you need
